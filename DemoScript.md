# Demo Script

Find here the steps usually taken for performing this demo.

## Demo preparation

A day before the demo you need to deploy two Synapse environments, the main one for the demo and an additional one for demonstrationg the QA deployment. You can use the provided Issue that uses an action for deploying the first environment, and then you create an empty one connected to the storage that was created for the first one.

The first environment should be connected to this repo, so follow the steps to connect the workspace to the repo, set the collab branch and use `/queries` as the `Root folder`, but do not check the "Import existing resource" option:
